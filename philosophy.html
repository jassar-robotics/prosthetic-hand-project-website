      <h1>We are building a prosthetic hand that people can grow with, repair, and own.</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        This project exists because access should not depend on price, geography, or a closed supply chain.
        We build in public so every test, failure, and improvement becomes a shortcut for the next person.

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why we build</h2>
      <p>
        Many prosthetic hands are expensive, hard to repair, and slow to update. Kids outgrow fittings quickly.
        Our answer is an open, modular hand that can be rebuilt, repaired, and improved by anyone with basic tools
        and a printer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not only a device, but a shared process that helps more people build, learn, and regain agency.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="principles">
      <h2>Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Human-first design.</strong> Comfort, natural motion, and daily tasks guide every decision.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth-ready.</strong> Replaceable parts and sizing guides keep the hand useful as kids grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Repairable everywhere.</strong> Clear parts lists and documented tools prevent supply lock-in.</li>
        <li><strong>Dignity and agency.</strong> A hand should feel like support, not a reminder of what is missing.</li>
        <li><strong>Open progress.</strong> Every test, failure, and fix is logged so the community can improve faster.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="impact">
      <h2>Who this helps</h2>
      <p>
        We design for classrooms, homes, clinics, and workshops. The hand should be adaptable to people and
        environments that change.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kids and teens.</strong> Modular upgrades keep costs low and fit changes quick.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents and caregivers.</strong> Clear assembly and repair guides reduce downtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinicians and therapists.</strong> Open notes help review alignment, grip patterns, and comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Makers and students.</strong> An open platform to learn biomechanics and human-centered design.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource-limited communities.</strong> Open files and local fabrication reduce dependency.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="process">
      <h2>How we work</h2>
      <p>
        Open hardware only works when the process is as visible as the result. This is the loop that keeps the
        hand improving and the community aligned.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Listen and define.</strong> Gather feedback from users, parents, and clinicians.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype and assemble.</strong> Print parts, assemble modules, track what breaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure and document.</strong> Log grip tests, cable tension notes, and wiring diagrams.</li>
        <li><strong>Share and invite.</strong> Publish results and open new tasks for the community.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="open-source">
      <h2>Open source commitment</h2>
      <p>
        We publish the design files, firmware, and documentation so anyone can study, build, or improve the hand.
        The repo license defines the exact terms; our commitment is to keep access open and credit clear.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparency.</strong> Everyone can see the design logic, not just the final model.</li>
        <li><strong>Resilience.</strong> If one team pauses, another can keep building.</li>
        <li><strong>Local adaptation.</strong> Communities can tune the hand to local materials and needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster iteration.</strong> More eyes on the build means faster fixes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contributing is impact, learning, and shared credit. Even a small fix today can become a major improvement
        for someone tomorrow. <a href="board.html">See open tasks</a>.

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <dl class="faq">
        <dt>Is this a medical device?</dt>
        <dd>No. This is an open hardware project in active development. Any clinical use should be evaluated with qualified professionals and local regulations.</dd>

        <dt>Why focus on kids?</dt>
        <dd>Kids outgrow devices quickly. A modular hand reduces the cost and downtime of upgrades.</dd>

        <dt>What stage is the project in?</dt>
        <dd>We are assembling and wiring the current build. The status board shows live tasks and priorities.</dd>

        <dt>How much does it cost?</dt>
        <dd>We aim to keep costs low and publish parts lists with alternatives. Actual costs vary by region and sourcing.</dd>

        <dt>What makes this different from commercial hands?</dt>
        <dd>Transparency, repairability, and community-driven iteration are built into the process, not added later.</dd>

        <dt>Can I build one at home?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, with access to 3D printing and basic tools. The documentation breaks down parts and assembly steps.</dd>

        <dt>How do you keep quality and safety?</dt>
        <dd>We document tests, publish failures, and review contributions before they are adopted in the build log.</dd>

        <dt>What does open source mean here?</dt>
        <dd>The design files and code are public so you can study and improve them under the repo license.</dd>

        <dt>Who can contribute?</dt>
        <dd>Anyone. We need CAD, electronics, firmware, testing, writing, translation, and outreach help.</dd>

        <dt>Will I get credit for my work?</dt>
        <dd>Yes. Contributions are logged in GitHub and highlighted on the contribution wall.</dd>

        <dt>What happens to my contribution?</dt>
        <dd>It is reviewed, tested, and then merged into the project so others can build on it.</dd>

        <dt>What do you need right now?</dt>
        <dd>Assembly notes, wiring diagrams, sensor tuning, and clean documentation. Check the board for details.</dd>

        <dt>How do you handle user feedback and privacy?</dt>
        <dd>Public logs focus on technical data. Any user feedback is shared only with consent and anonymized.</dd>

        <dt>How do I reach the team?</dt>
        <dd>Open an issue in the GitHub docs or website repo so we can track and respond publicly.</dd>
