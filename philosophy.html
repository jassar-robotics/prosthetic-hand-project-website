        <h2>We build because access to independence should not be rare.</h2>
        <p>
          Many prosthetic hands are expensive, hard to repair, and slow to update. Kids outgrow fittings quickly.
          Our answer is an open, modular hand that can be rebuilt, repaired, and improved by anyone with basic tools
          and a printer. The goal is not only a device, but a shared process that helps more people build, learn,
          and regain agency.
